# Implementation: Multi-Surface — dod CLI + tr-implement skill

## Behaviour
../usecase.md

## Design Decisions
- Cascade lives in `taproot dod` (CLI) and `tr-implement` step 5a (skill) — both paths can complete an impl; either alone would leave gaps
- `cascadeUsecaseState()` exported from `dod.ts` so it can be unit-tested independently of the full DoD run
- Cascade is intentionally one-directional: `specified` → `implemented` only; reversal is a human decision
- Silent no-op when parent state is already `implemented`/beyond — prevents accidental downgrades
- Missing `usecase.md` returns null and skips silently; `validate-format` will surface the underlying structural issue

## Source Files
- `src/commands/dod.ts` — `cascadeUsecaseState()` function + calls after `markImplComplete()` in both the DoD-configured and no-DoD paths
- `src/core/dod-runner.ts` — added `usecaseCascade?: string` to `DodReport` interface
- `skills/implement.md` — step 5a updated to advance usecase state alongside adding the link section

## Commits
- (run `taproot link-commits` to populate)
- `7ba1ecdc69a7759550a9b287f2ff7e88dd48d3cc` — (auto-linked by taproot link-commits)
- `d5dfd104dc3b8c05ff4416f05c89aaeb375d089d` — (auto-linked by taproot link-commits)

## Tests
- `test/integration/dod.test.ts` — cascadeUsecaseState: advances specified→implemented, no-op if already implemented, graceful missing usecase; runDod cascade: cascades on pass, skips on dry-run, skips on fail

## Status
- **State:** complete
- **Created:** 2026-03-19

## DoD Resolutions
- condition: document-current | note: Added cascade behaviour to taproot dod description in docs/cli.md | resolved: 2026-03-19T21:57:22.440Z
- condition: check-if-affected: skills/guide.md | note: cascade is automatic behavior of taproot dod, not a user-facing command — no guide update needed | resolved: 2026-03-19T21:57:22.897Z

- condition: check-if-affected: src/commands/update.ts | note: update.ts refreshes adapters/skills — not affected by impl state cascade logic | resolved: 2026-03-19T21:57:22.671Z

- condition: sweep-taproot-yaml-rename | note: .taproot.yaml references updated to .taproot/settings.yaml across the project; this impl.md contains no such references — no content changes required | resolved: 2026-03-20
